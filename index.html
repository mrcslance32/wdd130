            <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hi there! My name is Marcus Lance." width="200">
            <p> Hi there! My name is Marcus Lance from Boise, Idaho. I am a father of 3 and married to my beautiful wife, Jenny. I have a four year old, 2 year old twins, and another set of twins on the way.
            My kids are named: Bella Danger Lance, Hope Legacy Lance, and Saylor Legend Lance. 
            On the way are: Levi Quest Lance and Maverick Conquer Lance. 
            I am going to have 5 kids under 5. Pretty crazy to think about! I met my wife doing musical theatre, so I have always been a creative type, 
            but I've always been involved with tech and sports too. I have a wide range of intrests.
            I moved out of California when seemingly everyone did in 2020 and ended up here in Idaho. My family absolutely loves it.
            We wish we had come out earlier. 
            I worked in fitness for a long time managing health clubs and loved helping people on their health and fitness paths. I lost 100lbs myself, so it was very fufilling to help others. 
            I have always been a people person and have been performing as long as I can remember. I have done a few tours across the country for original bands that I sang for and I still write for other people 
            that hire me. Right now I front a premire cover band that plays in the tri-state area for festivals and large scale events. 
            Come see me on stage! 
            </p>
